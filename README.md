# UIFadeFX
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Cleanroom-brightgreen.svg)

This mod injects temporal visual effects into vanilla Minecraft UI, like 
fade-in/out effect for hovering a button.

UIFadeFX uses smooth damp for UI animations, making it less sensitive to disruptions, more smooth in short.

## Dependency
